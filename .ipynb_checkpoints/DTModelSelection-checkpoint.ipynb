    "The function `validation_curve()` finds the best value for one hyperparameter. What if you want to find the best combination of hyperparameter values for more than one hyperparameter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn has a class named `GridSearchCV` that allows you to search over different combinations of possible hyperparameter values to find the set that results in the best cross-validation (CV) score. It accomplishes what you implemented in one line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "It enables us to find the best-performing combination of values for several hyperparameters. You can find the names of the `DecisionTreeClassifier` hyperparameters in the [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html). You can also find more information on `GridSearchCV` in the corresponding [scikit-learn documentaton](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html). Note that for a classifier, `GridSearchCV` uses the scikit-learn `accuracy_score` metric by default. Also note that there are different ways to specify the number of folds using the parameter `cv`. You can supply it the output of scikit-learn's `KFolds`, but for simplicity, in this unit's exercises we will ask you to supply an integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to determine the optimal choice for two hyperparameters when fitting a decision model to our training data: the maximum depth of the tree (`max_depth`) and the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node (`min_samples_leaf`). We will run a grid search over the set of possible parameter value pairs, computing the accuracy score each time. These scores should help us decide on the optimal values of the two parameters.\n"
