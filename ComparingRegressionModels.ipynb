To compute the RMSE, we will use the scikit-learn ```mean_squared_error()``` function. Since RMSE finds the difference between the predicted and actual values, lower RMSE values indicate good performance - the model fits the data well and makes more accurate predictions. On the other hand, higher RSME values indicate that the model is not performing well.\n",

    "$R^2$ is a measure of the proportion of variability in the prediction that the model was able to make using the test data. An $R^2$ value of 1 is perfect and 0 implies no explanatory value. We can use scikit-learn's ```r2_score()``` function to compute it. Since $R^2$ measures how well the model fits the data, a higher $R^2$ value indicates that good performance and a lower $R^2$ indicates that poor performance.\n",
